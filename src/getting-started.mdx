# Getting Started

## Installation

`npm i react-stateless-modal`

## Basic usage

**Call the `openModal` function**

Invoke the `openModal` function to spawn a modal as depicted below:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { openModal } from "react-stateless-modal";
import "react-stateless-modal/dist/modalStyle.css";

class Example extends Component {
  openModal = () => {
    openModal({
      header: () => (
        /* component or string to render header */
      ),
      body: () => (
        /* component or string to render body */
      ),
      footer: () => (
        /* component or string to render footer */
      ),

      classNames: { overlay: className for overlay, modal: className for the modal, closeIcon: className for close icon},

      closeOnEscape: /* Setting true closes the modal on pressing escape key setting false does the opposite (Optional)*/,

      closeIcon: { src: IconObject, alt: alt text for the icon},

      animation: { name: choose from 'bounce', 'fade-in' and 'zoom' animation, duration: 'animationDuration'},

      containerId: /* Id of the custom container over which you would like the modal to be mounted */,

      modalId: /* specify the id of your choice that the modal will take */

      disableOverlayClick: /* setting true prevents the modal from closing when overlay is clicked */
    });
  };
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.openModal}>Open Modal</button>;
  }
}
```
The modal will be mounted for you. The modal has a default animation.
Setting an class can help in styling the modal.
By default closeOnEscape is set to true.
Pass additional styles to create a modal that suits your needs.

**Mount `Modal` using component mode**

You may additionally choose to spawn a modal by directly mounting the `Modal` component. You may use all the properties used in the object passed to the `openModal` function. But this option may prove impractical for implementing nested modals.

**close a modal using `closeModal` method**

You may close a modal by using the polymorphic method, `closeModal`. Calling the close method without arguments will close the current modal. You may also pass modalIDs to close the modals that correspond to those ids.
```jsx
import { modalClose } from 'react-stateless-modal';
```
usage
```jsx
closeModal(id0, id1, id2, ....) // this function call will close all the ids passed to it
```

```jsx
closeModal() // This function will close only the current modal.
```

## Demo

A basic modal with all the options provided:

<iframe
     src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/gracious-ride-6qk5y?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="gracious-ride-6qk5y"
     allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
     sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
   ></iframe>


## Options that can be passed to `openModal`

<Props />

## Props to be passed to while using component mode
You may pass all the options in that can be passed to `openModal` as props to component mode. Additionally you also need to pass `open` and `onClose` props to that control modal's opening. 

<ComponentModeProps />
